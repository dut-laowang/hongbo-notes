By comparing the return values of different trajectories, we can determine which overall policy performs better.\nDiscounted return\nBy applying the discount factor γ, we can place more emphasis on either short-term or long-term rewards.\nEpisode\nWhen the number of states is finite, the resulting trajectory is referred to as an episode.\nMarkov Decision Process\nMost importantly, the next decision is not influenced by previous decisions, which is known as the property of being memoryless.\n\n\nSection 1.2 - Connection\nThese concepts are interconnected. The transition from one state to another, which generates a reward, is illustrated in Figure 1.\n\nImage source: Shiyu Zhao, Westlake University\nThe accumulation of multiple states, forming a Trajectory (or Episode), and eventually leading to a return is shown in Figure 2.\n\nImage source: Shiyu Zhao, Westlake University\n\n\nSection 2 - Bellman Equation\nBootstrapping\nThe value of a state depends on the estimated values of subsequent states.\n\nReturn\nThe cumulative sum of rewards collected over time, representing the long-term value of a trajectory.\n\nIt is the total discounted reward from a given state, considering both immediate and future rewards.\nMathematically, it is defined as:\n\\[\nG_t = R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \\dots\n\\]\n\\[\nG_t = R_{t+1} + \\gamma (R_{t+2} + \\gamma R_{t+3} + \\dots)\n\\]\n\\[\nG_t = R_{t+1} + \\gamma G_{t+1}\n\\]\n\n\nState Value && Bellman Equation\nIn reinforcement learning, the state value refers to the expected return starting from a given state, following a particular policy.\n\nIt quantifies how good it is for the agent to be in a state ( s ).\nFormally defined as:\n\\[\nv_\\pi(s) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[G_t \\mid s_t = s\\right]\n\\]\nwhich can be expressed as:\n\\[\nv_\\pi(s) = \\mathbb{E}[R_{t+1} + \\gamma G_{t+1} \\mid S_t = s]\n\\]\n\\[  \nv_\\pi(s) = \\sum_{a} \\pi(a|s) \\left[ \\sum_{r} p(r|s,a) r + \\gamma \\sum_{s'} p(s'|s,a) v_\\pi(s') \\right]\n\\]\n\n\nMatrix Form of Bellman Equation\nThe Bellman equation in matrix form can be written as:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{v_\\pi} = \\mathbf{R_\\pi} + \\gamma \\mathbf{P_\\pi} \\mathbf{v_\\pi}\n\\] \nImage source: Shiyu Zhao, Westlake University\n\nAction Value Function\nState value represents the expected long-term return an agent will receive starting from a state, while following a specific policy.\nAction value represents the expected long-term return an agent will receive after taking a specific action in a state, and then continuing to follow a specific policy."
